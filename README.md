Module 4 Challenge - Data Analysis(Summary and Conclusion) 

PyCity Schools has a total budget of more than $24 million for 15 schools which includes 7 Government-based school and 8 Independent-based school. Around 39 thousand students are enrolled between Year 9 to 12 in these educational institutions. Moreover, a quick snapshot showcases that if Math and Reading subjects are assessed individually, the passing of students is above 80%, however, if the two subjects were assessed in combination, the overall passing rate is only at 72% for students in the area.

The top five performing schools with high overall passing rate for Math and Reading are dominated by Independent-type schools while the least five performing schools are predominantly Government-type schools.

The highest maths scores of students in each level are from Independent-type schools:
	Year 9:  Shelton High School (72.93)
	Year 10: Holden High School (75.10)
	Year 11: Wright High School (73.27)
	Year 12: Holden High School (73.40)

The highest reading scores of students in each level are mostly from Independent-type schools, with the exception in Year 12: 
	Year 9: Griffin High School (72.03)
	Year 10: Penna High School (72.32)
	Year 11: Holden High School (73.31)
	Year 12:  Bailey High School (73.0)

Independent Schools have a higher passing rate in both Reading and Maths compared to Government-based Schools. This can be seen at the scores of students in each year level. This may be due to the fact that Independent Schools have various school resources (e.g., after school tutorials, math clubs, renovated libraries, etc.) that supports students in their studies.

Smaller classes will likely have more in-depth discussion with the lecturer, as the teachers can provide more guidance and expertise on the subject to a small size classroom in which students will likely comprehend the lessons provided.

Interestingly, the range of $585 – $630 budget per student has the optimum results with the student scores in both Maths and Reading. Schools should consider investing this amount of money allocated per student in school resources to achieve high scores in both subjects for the next curriculum.
